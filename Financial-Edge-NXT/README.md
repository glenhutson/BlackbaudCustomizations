# Financial Edge NXT Customizations
The examples found here focus on Financial Edge NXT.  For those that include "SHR" in the name, please see the information in the [Send-HTTP-Request.md](./Send-HTTP-Request.md) file.  

## Support
As with all examples in this repository, support is given exclusively via the Microsoft Integrations dicussions at https://community.blackbaud.com/forums/viewcategory/586 (URL accurate as of the time of this writing).  This can be done either via replying to the orignal post dicussing a specific example or via a new dicussion and "tagging" the author.  Direct messages to the author will be redirected back to the main Microsoft Integrations disscussion area.
