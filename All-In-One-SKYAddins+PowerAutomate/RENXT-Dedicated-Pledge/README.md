## <a name='Summary'></a>Summary
Raiser's Edge NXT Web View has dedicated tiles for reviewing overall Giving as well as the Giving History.  Once clicking on "Work with gifts", you can further filter on the types of gifts you want to see, including pledges and associated balance.  If your organization works with a lot of pledges, having a dedicated Pledge tile may be a nice to have.  This All In One flow places a Dedicated Pledge tile right on the Constituent record.  Clicking on the Gift ID activates a fly-out showing the original pledge record.
