# All In One SKY Add-In + Power Automate 
This is a collection of one or more (depending on feedback) examples of creating SKY Add-ins or Blackbaud CRM API based customizations without the need of an external Single Page Application/SPA. See the individual folder(s) for more information. 

## Existing Shortcuts / Methods
* If your customization is utilizing a _Power App_, then you can use (for NXT) the pre-made [Power Apps Host SPA](https://docs.blackbaud.com/microsoft-connectors-docs/microsoft-power-platform/power-apps/power-app-addins) directly or (for Blackbaud CRM) native embedding without needing to have that additional SPA / webpage. 
* If your customization is utilizing _Power BI_, then you can use (for NXT) the pre-made [Power BI Host SPA](https://docs.blackbaud.com/microsoft-connectors-docs/microsoft-power-platform/power-bi/power-bi-addins) or (for Blackbaud CRM) the native embedding). 
* If your NXT customization is a button that is meant to trigger a flow to perform an action, then you can use the pre-made [Web Request Action SPA ](https://docs.blackbaud.com/microsoft-connectors-docs/microsoft-power-platform/power-automate/invoke-a-flow). 

What remains is if you're working with a scenario outside of those, namely wanting to simply show the results of a Power Automate flow within a  SKY Add-in or a Blackbaud CRM tab/page.
